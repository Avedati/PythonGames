# Python Games

These are a collection of some of my earliest programs (following the two and three dimensional Rubik's Cubes). These games are
all written in python using a graphics library for python known as pygame. Some of the games are clones of simple games, such
as Pong, Breakout, or the 15 Puzzle. The other games are based on my own concepts. Most have rudimentary graphics, a product
of my programming knowledge at the time.

## Getting Started

To play any of these games, you will need python 2 and the pygame library. Python can be installed from the python website or
using your package manager if you are on a linux distribution.

Pygame installation is operating system dependent.

### For Windows users

You will need to install pip. If you do not have it already, it can be installed using the commands shown on this website:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/

After this, you will need to find the appropriate .whl file for your operating system architecture. The .whl file can then be
installed using pip.

### For macOS users

Installing pygame with python 2 on macOS is a slightly more involved process. You will need to have Homebrew for macOS.
It can be installed here: https://brew.sh
Instructions for installing pygame with python 2 on macOS can be found here:

### For Linux users

Simply use your package manager to install pygame.

## Running the games

Any of the games can be played by opening a terminal and running:
```
python [games/name.py]
```
